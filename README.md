# Looper Demo

Demonstration of a 254-style looper paradigm, taking advantage of the Android-usable `java.util.concurrent` functionality instead of the FRC WPILib `Notifier`, which uses timing from the roboRIO FPGA. This does create a small timing error, tested at +- .5 ms with a 100 hz loop timing.
